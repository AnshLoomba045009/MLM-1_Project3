ntroduction This report presents a detailed analysis of data and modeling techniques applied to a dataset containing game performance statistics. The dataset comprises 5,000 entries, each described by 26 columns, including gameid, date, type, playerid, player, team, home, away, MIN, and various percentage statistics related to game performance. The primary objective of this analysis is to compare the performance of the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms in predicting game outcomes based on player and team statistics.
Data Preprocessing The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure its suitability for analysis and modeling. Numerical variables were scaled and standardized to bring them to a common scale, while categorical variables were transformed using OneHotEncoding to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms. Missing values were handled using appropriate techniques, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering - K-Means {K = 2, 3, 4, 5} • Description of Data: The dataset consists of 5,000 customer entries, each described by 26 columns, including gameid, date, type, playerid, player, team, home, away, MIN, and various percentage statistics related to game performance. • Objective(s) of Data Analysis: Identify natural groupings within the customer base based on their game performance statistics. • Observations: o For k=3, the Silhouette Score is 0.3464, indicating reasonably well-separated clusters. o The Davies-Bouldin Score for k=3 is 1.2526, suggesting good cluster quality. • Managerial Insights: Clustering customers based on their game performance can provide insights into different player types and strategies, which can inform coaching decisions and team strategies.
Supervised Learning: Classification - Decision Tree vs Random Forest • Description of Data: The dataset used for classification includes a subset of 5,000 records, each described by 26 columns, including gameid, date, type, playerid, player, team, home, away, MIN, and various percentage statistics related to game performance. • Objective(s) of Data Analysis: Build models to classify game outcomes based on player and team statistics. • Observations: o Decision Tree:  Accuracy: 0.52  Precision: 0.519  Recall: 0.52  F1 Score: 0.52 o Random Forest:  Accuracy: 0.521  Precision: 0.521  Recall: 0.521  F1 Score: 0.521 • Comparison: The Random Forest algorithm slightly outperformed the Decision Tree algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This can be attributed to the ensemble nature of the Random Forest algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to make more robust and accurate predictions. The Random Forest algorithm is able to reduce overfitting and variance compared to a single decision tree, resulting in better performance.
Conclusion The analysis and modeling conducted on the game performance dataset revealed valuable insights into player and team statistics. Clustering helped identify natural groupings within the customer base, while classification models provided accurate predictions of game outcomes. The Random Forest algorithm emerged as the top-performing model, offering slightly better performance metrics compared to the Decision Tree.
Recommendations Based on the findings of this analysis, it is recommended to use the Random Forest algorithm for predicting game outcomes based on player and team statistics. This model can provide more accurate predictions and help coaches and team managers make informed decisions to improve team performance and strategy.
Future Research Directions Future research could focus on exploring additional features or incorporating more advanced modeling techniques to further improve the accuracy and performance of game outcome predictions. Additionally, conducting a comparative analysis with other ensemble learning algorithms could provide further insights into the effectiveness of different modeling approaches for this task.
